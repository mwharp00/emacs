Even though I use and like the layout, I'm not much of a
evangelist. Lenny Kubiak, when I asked him secrets of business success
(this during the time I was constantly looking out for something
intelligent to say regarding No. 1 son's attempt to find his way in
the economy) said, "For me, it is typing. I can type 120 wpm while I
am having a conversation with someone." Qwerty. That said, I have
followed a ton of threads, emacs and otherwise, that cover layouts,
keyboards, and RSI. Kathleen is fast (qwerty) but has had RSI
issues. She solved it w/ ergonomics. A keyboard caddy, Goldtouch
keyboard and a vertical mouse. Me, I was going along w/ Dragon Nat
Speak saying dictating sure is different than writing!?! Now as I am
well into my baby steps with touch-typing, the most important thing
for me is the the swapping of control and alt for C- and M-. That way
I can curl my thumb under to hit the key next to the space bar. Since
the caps lock has no C- duties, I mapped it to Backspace. As long as
we are here, do you have a docs key between the right and left Alt and
Control keys? I map that to Super in emacs. Don't worry Celestia,
emacs will be in a separate post. But here, in W32 (easier to type
 than Windoze) there is AHK -- AutoHotKey. Essential tool. Good enough
that there is a port to Linux. Get it. Create a file -- mine is
swap.keys.ahk -- .ahk is the required part. In the file:


;; Remap Keys in Windows.
LAlt::LCtrl
RAlt::RCtrl
RCtrl::RAlt
Capslock::BS
LCtrl::LAlt


Put it where you can find it. Double click - it calls and runs. Oh and
the glory of the dvorak "the" for me, it is hyphen on the right
pinky. All day long, I'm ready: ----- :)<-- my first emoticon...

That's good, 24.4 is not out yet. Soon...

You remember when I was visiting SD; looking at some math notation. I
express shock. You, "Dad, it is just a language." A cartoon: 2 people
in a room with a blackboard covered w/ math. But in the middle of it
is this plain language: then a miracle appears. Then the notation
continues...  Now I am not being critical and I am not saying that
this chain of events are unlikely (or impossible like a miracle), just
that there are some unexamined things here. I think the caption may
have been, "you may need to flesh out this part here..." So in the
grand fleshout tradition (there is no such tradition - I made it up)
Leave current digs, move to cheaper digs, save, buy, save so that you
pay off principal, sell, and then buy. The first two are not really
rich in money concepts in that they are more like decisions. I am
willing to pay X to live like Y. Financially savvy individuals might
stay even with the rent increase; others may go. We talked about the
cheapest in the context of your lunch group -- it is a fool's
errand. "So living in my van, I pay no home or rental insurance..."
Who cares? A good way to think about these sorts of decisions -- you
paid rent in a cool San Diego neighborhood. Liked it, even though it
was a higher proportion of your income than the current L55 place. The
prospect of saving enough to purchase in that place is onerous. It
would take years. You did it and liked it and moved on. Call this the
"this is your life" principle. In other words, I've been living for
tomorrow my whole life and then I died. Dammit!

Or this one: A lot of us are working harder than we want, at things we
   don't like to do. Why? ...In order to afford the sort of existence
   we don't care to live.  -Bradford Angier

Now a money principle: You must know what you are paying. A great book
from my youth -- Your Money or Your Life really illuminated this. Get
a job. It pays X. Does it? Need another car, more insurance, more
wardrobe (assuming a Value Village shopper like my son, this would be
NA) and doggie daycare. Now maybe you still take the job, but you
understand the arithmetic. Same as choosing where you live; taxes,
commute expenses, and time spent for both of you on the road. All must
be considered. Quantify everything that can be quantified. When you
are looking at uncertain things in the future, you still must
quantify. That means take your best guess and then revisit it and
continue to refine it. Is that a Bayesian process? Can you predict the
weekly driving to be done in three years time? That's OK,
guess. What's the motorcycle cost? What will be the replacement for
the car? When?

So what we are talking about here is a budget. We are at another money
concept here. I read one financial planner that puts every client
through a budget exercise. Now if you are making 20,000 a month; why
go through an exercise of estimating what you spend on food? The
reason is that it is still useful to identify overspending; spending
that does not reflect your own priorities. Also, she notes that most
can cut one third of their spending with out significant pain. The
goal is not to necessarily cut, but to know that you can. A budget
should be a no fear thing. These are my priorities. This is what we
want. They are reflected in how much I spend and what I spend it
on. There is another level of complexity in a marriage. Two people and
one budget that each has to buy into. I have no formula for you here
other than to be explicit and to use tit-for-tat principles. You have
a ton of really important things that you have to collaborate on --
sex, children, food... A budget should be small potatoes. Going back
to the previous planner, we went from quantification to a budget, but
she goes further. You need quantification in assets, liabilities, and
future needs to obtain goals. Because this goes so deep into so many
aspects of life, she recommends a bite-size approach. Get a steno
notebook and spend 20 min. every other day putting together your
plan. What is the match in HP's 401(k)? Put it in dere. Any bennies
with HP stock? What will your income be in 5 years? Where you are now
is a pretty simple state. But the principles apply lifelong. Net
worth, income, expenses, long-term goals, long-term savings, and other
balances will be a fixture from here on out. What is important to you
two? At this level investing is just a piece. All this is foundational
to decisions for example, of paying down principal. The $150,000 in
your pocket is money paid to you as wages, and that is net, after
taxes.

Now let's turn to the real estate question. To my mind, there is one
clear benefit to buying a home and that is the mortgage interest
deduction. This works out to a small subsidy for the amount of your
mortgage payment that is interest. Your plan of paying off early
changes that equation. But remember that you are also assuming
responsibility for a property that could create hugely expensive
demands on you. You will think "man, how cool would it be to simply
call the landlord -- sorry, the sewage pipe broke... But that is just
the fine print. Like many, and like me (though now less and less, it
is an age thing), you want to own a house. The mortgage interest
deduction probably covers a good percentage of your costs of
maintenance of the physical plant. I like your first post
better. Here's why: Don't really have the money -- good. Where you are
at is implied. See above for sketchy budget info. Not worth my time to
type or locate a bazillion links. Here is one: [[http://www.bettermoneyhabits.com/en/videos/khan-partnership.html#fbid%3DVS_p4V2EHDB][Khan Academy and Bank
of America Partnership from Better Money Habits]] Don't really know
where we want to live -- good. A set of questions to research is
implied. Here is an awesome tool: [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2013/11/09/washington-a-world-apart/][zip code demographics]]. The
granularity is, of course at the level of the zipcode, so my place in
St Louis shows up more down than it really is as it includes a ghetto
N of Delmar. 63112 if you wish to see. Here's the thing, you also have
to make guesses about the future. The neighborhood did become bombed
out in the 70s -- Ernst and Frances stayed but they didn't love their
life with bars on the windows. Not relevent? Yes, it is. It is a
particular kind of real estate risk, neighborhoods change over
time. By definition you deal with it because you pay for the hot
neighborhood and get the pedestrian one at a discount. Over time --
key real estate concept -- things get better and better for you. The
dollars you pay to your fixed rate mortgage get cheaper and
cheaper. The value of the home also appreciates. The virtue of
inflation (!?!) does all this for you. But it takes years, hopefully
not years punctuated w/ 50% drops like 2008. Short term, the
transaction costs will skin you alive. So start the process. And why
limit your search now? It is free to research. Throw in the 1 bdrm in
the sexy Portland youth ghetto. Condo fees? Loft development failed?
Oregon state taxes? Really close to HP? Really close to Celestia's
school? Seriously, you two learned in SoCal -- spend small amounts of
time on the road...

On to investment, yes save 10% and invest 100% of it. You want
something to set and forget for decades. You two are busy improving
your skills; you don't need to learn the intricacies of this
discipline. If there is intellectual curiosity, a library book:
Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street by Peter
L. Bernstein

75% of those who study and work hard in this field do worse than
this. Simply buy very inexpensive index funds or ETFs that mirror the
global economy. In 2008, it was something like US 41%, developed world
EAFE Europe, Asia, and Far East 47% and the developing world 12%.

BTW, investing in yourselves is wonderful. The returns are great and
the serendipity factor is off the charts. It doesn't count against the
10% savings but it should be budgeted and funded as a great
investment.
 
The order to do these things are tied for first, pay off debt and do
the 401(k) matching funds. Second, more saving that is tax
advantaged. This is tax deducted. Emergency funds -- you can probably
do without and just rely on a sob story to open the Daddy-O, Baby
purse strings.

"One thing at a time. Most important thing first. Start now." Save 10%
of gross.

While gains and losses do affect your wealth, it is far more important
to focus on your process than on your performance. Develop and stick
to a consistent, well-defined approach to investing based on what has
been proven to work over the long term... AAII

Perhaps the check writing was abrupt, but I wanted to convey the fact that I am in. 

You can subcontract as you wish, so long as it makes economic sense. 

Record keeping can be done as you wish. If you want to send the info in email -- that's fine. If you would rather do it long hand, you could make copies and send them in the mail.

Rate of pay was not discussed, and maybe that is just as well. $15/hr is $120 for an 8 hr day and $20 of course is $160. Maybe using these 

==

I have my schedule and unfortunately my last day off is 5 June. I will be on my way to the tropics when Nicky is getting his diploma. I talked to Grace and she is planning on making it. I also have news on the Grace front. She passed her examination. Maybe that should be a capital letter. I know that champagne was poured after the several hour oral. Only four years to go!

Any progress on the gift identification project? If I should call Nicky to analyze the situation, let me know.

I started this initial e-mail weeks ago. I was struggling with all of these angles regarding pay rates, estimates, bookkeeping and priorities. It turned out that the best thing to do was to step back and let Donetta and Taylor go to work. The phone call brought the great news that the outside was already nearly done (I concur on waiting on the mulch) and noticed by the neighbors.

I am not saying that being a slow writer is a good thing; but it worked out well in this situation.

I apologize if on that Friday it seemed abrupt at the end of our conversation. Maybe there were so many decisions to be made that I got exhausted. But I also wanted to demonstrate that I was "in".  So that is how the check came about.

I don't know how good my notes are, but I will try to put together a sheet of items that we can work from. I'm sure together we can come up with a complete list. I do understand that there are many, many decisions that remain to be made inside the house. There is probably no reason to work on a timeline until the decisions on the big items like kitchen redo and the like are resolved. I also need to do some sort of inventory so that we know which things are staying and which are going to my home in New York and the possible future flophouse in Miami.

I will be in St. Louis on 5 June for my flight physical. We will talk before then.

Thanks again for the good work.
