**** Taxes
***** strategy
With experts predicting equity returns will average just 6% per year, taxes will make a big difference in what counts most—your aftertax return. Be strategic. Keep taxable bonds and high-turnover funds producing short-term capital gains in tax-deferred retirement accounts. Hold individual stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of the low long-term gains rate and tax-loss harvesting. Hedge against higher rates by converting some of your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.

***** Volatility
Volatility isn’t going away. The average daily closing value of the CBOE’s Volatility Index has nearly doubled since the mid-2000s, and so far in 2011 the S&P 500 has swung more than 1% on 75 trading days. Turn volatility into profits. One way is to hedge your portfolio by taking a 5% stake in a VIX futures fund. Another way is to use wild, seemingly irrational moves as buying opportunities.
***** Income
A few decades ago only “mature” stocks paid dividends and only retirees bought bonds. Today, despite a near-zero interest rate environment, there are a slew of 5%-plus income options, from junk bonds to energy partnerships. As for stocks, studies show that long term, dividend-payers outperform non-dividend-payers and are less volatile. Corporate cash coffers are flush. Companies are jumping on the dividend bandwagon. Intel offers a 3.5% yield. Apple could be next. Embrace it.

******** mail
	 Looking at my illustrious fancy new google analytics, I think most of the hits on this blog are people looking for how to read their email in Emacs. As I support such behavior, I have collected links to all of the relevant posts here, in chronological order. This is still exactly how I read my email on my laptop every day. What used to take between one and two hours with Evolution or Thunderbird now takes 20 minutes. Good luck!
	 
	 1 - Get mail with fetchmail or getmail.cyg=get
	 
	 2 - Deliver mail with maildrop.no cyg
	 
	 3 - Analyize mail with Spamassassin.no cyg
	 
	 4 - Run a local IMAP server using Dovecot.no cyg
	 
	 5 - Send mail with Gnus and msmtp.
	 
	 And finally, use Gnus to read you email.
	 
Steps 1, 2, and 4 might be fortuitously replaced with a decent IMAP cache, of which there are several, but I personally insist on storing my email on the hard drive that is right in front of me. I also like to wear pants and close my window shades from time to time. It's nothing personal.
=
2. offlineimap+nnmaildir
Use offlineimap to sync all emails to local machine(s). And add five
nnmaildir to gnus-second-select-methods. Much faster.

You can have a try. Absolutely not difficult as you may think.

FYI, I use Emacs 23 and No Gnus 0.6.
=
I gave it a try for a while but it just required the user to do
things the way gnus wanted and not what made sense as a mail program.
I liked using vm and gnus together.  Any Usenet articles I wanted to
save I could have gnus save into the folders I used for vm and read
them later in vm.

vm works great and is compatible with TB's mail folders since they
both use (well, vm can also use other formats too) good old rfc822 /
mbox text files.  TB adds index files to speed up access, which I
don't think vm will use.  Here's some more detail:

I'm starting off with nothing. I have a directory containing some .org

we go...

> 1. What needs to be setup for the first time push from Emacs to the
> Dropbox Apps/MobileOrg directory?

I added the following to .emacs:

#+begin_src .emacs

;; where are the .org files you want on your phone?
(setq org-directory "~/vault/personal/home-notes")

;; where is your sync directory going to be?
(setq org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/mobile-org")

;; if you make changes on your phone, where do you want the chnages
;; to live?
(setq org-mobile-inbox-for-pull "~/vault/personal/home-notes/mobileorg.org")

;; what files in org-directory do you want synced?
(setq org-mobile-files '("~/vault/personal/home-notes/home-notes.org"
                         "~/vault/personal/home-notes/personal.org"
                         "~/vault/personal/home-notes/todo.org"
                         "~/vault/personal/home-notes/whisky.org"))
#+end_src

> 2. What should the results of the first time push be that I should check
> to ensure that it worked?

I'm writing this is as I go... but here's what happened for me! I
ended up with the following directory structure:

$ tree --charset=ASCII ~/Dropbox/mobile-org/
/home/jwhendy/Dropbox/mobile-org/
|-- agendas.org
|-- checksums.dat
|-- home-notes.org
|-- index.org
|-- mobileorg.org
|-- personal.org
|-- todo.org
`-- whisky.org

> 3. What is MobileOrg looking for in the Dropbox directory?

The maintainer would better be able to answer this... but for one,
it's looking for the index.org file, which tells it about the files
contained. If you have custom agenda views, it will tell it about
those as well. I think the checksums.dat file has something to do with
whether or not things need to be re-synced or if they're up to date.

> 4. What do I need to configure in MobileOrg?

My steps (though, on Android, not iOS):

- Open MobileOrg, choose "I want to sync using: a Dropbox account"
- I'm taken to a login screen for Dropbox; click "Log in"
- Dropbox app opens and asks if I want to give permission to
MobileOrg; I choose "Allow"
- Like a silly pants, I didn't sync Dropbox after doing the above
step, so the folder isn't listed
- Start Dropbox on Linux and let it sync
- Click back a few times in MobileOrg and re-do the above steps to
refresh the directory list
- Choose my mobile-org directory from the list of available Dropbox
folders, click "Done"
- Then I'm taken to a sort of home screen with options: Setup Wizard,
Settings, Synchronize, Webstie
- Click "Synchronize"
- A list of my .org files pops up in the app and I can navigate around
and look at them


> 5. What will MobileOrg put back in the Dropbox directory?

I pressed the + in the upper right (again, Android app...) which
opened up a capture interface.

- I title the note "Test"
- There was a dropdown menu for the file to store it in; I chose
"Captures", which was automatically created for me.
- I added the following text:

#+begin_src mobile capture

 * heading
  
 ** sub heading?
  
 #+end_src
  
 I pressed the synchronize icon in the upper right and... the
 "Captures" file vanished!! Like I said, I was typing this in real time
 :) I did the same thing (pressed the + symbol in the upper right to
 create a capture), except this time, no "Captures" file was
 created/suggested, and instead an already existing file,
 home-notes.org, was the default. I left it as that and added a capture
 titled "Test" with the content text, "stuff." I tapped to synchronize
 again.
  
 Back on the computer, I opened up mobileorg.org (where we told new
 stuff to go) and found the following contents:
  
 #+begin_src mobileorg.org
  
 * Test
  
 * a heading
  
 ** sub heading?
  
 * F(edit:addheading) [[olp:home-notes.org][home-notes.org]]
 ** Old value
  
 ** New value
 Test
 stuff
 ** End of edit
  
 #+end_src
  
 So, looks like it did get my initial captures, along with some
 interesting structure for what it's going to add to my home-notes.org
 file.
  
 > 6. What do I need to do to get Emacs to pull from the Dropbox directory?
  
 Now that there was some content in mobileorg.org, I saved
 home-notes.org as home-notes.org.bk (just to compare to for you) and
 then ran `M-x org-mobile-pull`. It opened up home-notes.org, and the
 message buffer printed out: 2 new, 1 edits, 0 flags, 0 errors
  
 It also add this to the top of the file: #+LAST_MOBILE_CHANGE:
 2014-03-01 21:01:22
  
 At the very end of the file, sure enough, I got this:
  
 #+begin_src added-stuff
  
 * Test
stuff

#+end_src

Remember how I saved a backup? When running `diff`, it confirms that
the only change was that headline I added from my phone:

#+begin_src sh

cd ~/vault/personal/home-notes
diff --suppress-common-lines ~/Desktop/home-notes.org.bk ./home-notes.org

> #+LAST_MOBILE_CHANGE: 2014-03-01 21:01:22
>
> * Test
> stuff

#+end_src

Now... where did the "homeless" captures end up from the mobileorg.org
file? From what I can tell, they stayed homeless. home-notes.org was
the only file that changed in the directory holding my .org files
(which we set above with the variable `org-directory`). I re-visited
the mobileorg.org file from the org-mobile-directory, and the big that
had been destined for home-notes.org was now gone! So,
`org-mobile-pull` successfully "refiled" that bit into home-notes.org
(where we told it to put it from the phone) and left the orphans there
for, I suppose, manual refiling by me.

> And so on.  Are the maintainers of MobileOrg watching this mailing list?

They have commented in the past (at least I'm pretty sure), but I
don't know. Like Bastien suggested, you can definitely give it a whirl

I hope the above has been helpful! For any others who follow along
and/or use MobileOrg, was the above at all helpful or was setup fairly
obvious? MobileOrg questions have come up before and I could give a
shot at setting up a Worg page. I'd basically populate it with the
above and perhaps leave an open spot for someone to chime in with iOS
specific instructions. Or should we leave documentation to the
MobileOrg apps themselves?

The above was just for fiddling. I want to sync work files, which I
can't make public on Dropbox, so my final setup will be WebDAV. I've
done it before, but stopped using it for a while. When I redo all the
steps (apache, webDAV, phone setup), I'd plan to add that
documentation to Worg as well. Or if no one voices a desire for that,
I'll just put it on my blog...

> 1. What needs to be setup for the first time push from Emacs to the
> Dropbox Apps/MobileOrg directory?

You will need to define org-mobile-directory, using Dropbox the correct
default setting is: "~/Dropbox/Apps/MobileOrg"

For example, I have

 (setq org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/Apps/MobileOrg")

in my config.

Then you can org-mobile-push to stage your files in this location.

You should not manually create any folders in Dropbox.

>
> 2. What should the results of the first time push be that I should check
> to ensure that it worked?

Your org-agenda-files will be staged and an index.org file and
checksums.dat will be created.

>
> 3. What is MobileOrg looking for in the Dropbox directory?

MobileOrg needs to be authorized as a dropbox app, this step will create
the correct path.

> 4. What do I need to configure in MobileOrg?
>
> 5. What will MobileOrg put back in the Dropbox directory?
>
> 6. What do I need to do to get Emacs to pull from the Dropbox directory?

org-mobile-pull will pull in changes.

***** overview
I'm hearing from a lot of people who are having issues with Outlook and iCloud integration. Some of the problems are to be expected: rather than syncing your existing data files as iTunes did, iCloud creates a new data file in Outlook and moves your appointments and contacts to it. This seems to create a lot of confusion when the to-do bar is suddenly bare and calendar and contacts folders are empty.

The iCloud database does not sync with the default calendar or contacts, so newly created items aren't synced with iCloud. Users will need to create the new appointments and contacts in the iCloud folders. While many consider this a "major fail" it's not hard to save items in other folders as long as you use the Move to folder command instead of Save and Close. Meeting requests are the exception: there isn't a really good method, short of copying the appointment after adding it to your calendar.

Because Exchange (including Office365), Gmail, and Hotmail mailboxes are already in the cloud and sync well with iPhone and iPad, it makes no sense to move them into iCloud.

(fastmail -- matters pop or imap?)

Our Outlook and iCloud coverage is at iCloud and Outlook Problems. We have answers to frequently asked questions, tips for making Outlook and iCloud work better together, and a video tutorial on using the Move to folder command.

***** planner/remind interact?
***** owncloud
****** Owncloud. I'm using that for calendar and contacts but files is just unusable.
***** BitTorrent Sync
***** Rsync is a great option for your own files, but becomes difficult as soon as you want to share any data, and impossible if you want to share with anyone lacking in geek-skills.
***** Sparkleshare is awsome for Git, but Git is not for binary. And most people use Dropbox for Binary data. Which is why I would use Seafile
***** What I ended up doing was using dropbox, and dropbox is installed on the linux server, then I have a script run every 30 minutes that moves the files from the dropbox folder to another folder on the server.

This way my dropbox folder is always empty so I have lots of space. I also have my cell phone set up so the any pictures, video, or audio recorded are automatically uploaded to dropbox, which in turn gets automatically saved to a folder on my server.

I guess my way wouldn't work for you though, as mine is a one-way transfer just to have a backup at home. Once I move the files from the dropbox folder there is no way for me to see them from my phone or other device again.
