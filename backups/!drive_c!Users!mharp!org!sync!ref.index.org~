**** 164 stereo
93 USA S
 Your 164 has a standard Chrysler 1.5 DIN radio in it. Your options are as follows:

1. Keep it
2. replace it with an upgraded Chrysler unit with a CD player or something
3. replace it with an aftermarket 1.5 DIN radio (I believe Pioneer and a few others make one) and you can create your own system
4. replace it with an aftermarket 1 DIN radio and get a filler plate from Cal Crouch.

I don't know if your radio will do really well with bigger speakers as the internal amp is most likely of marginal quality at best designed only to drive the speakers supplied. If you put in nicer speakers and keep your current head unit then you will probably damage the speakers due to the low quality power signal (relatively speaking) that they will recieve. 

The 94 & 95 164s use a standard DIN sized radio. The stock radio is made by Fujitsu Ten (they also make Eclipse brand radios). It uses an amp that sits underneath the passenger side seat. You can upgrade the speakers on these cars to a degree without changing the factory head unit or amp because they are of a better quality.

I'm not sure if the head unit to amp connections are line level or not so you'll have to test it first if you wish to upgrade both the amp and speakers while keeping the standard head unit.

If you wish to change the head unit for an aftermarket one it is very straightforward as the wires running from the amp to the speakers are very clearly labeled for each speaker. Just make sure that you leave enough of a pigtail that you can re-install the factory set-up at a later date because factory stuff is always worth more for resale.

The stock head unit in these cars also has a 12 disc cd changer control which can be hooked up to the stock accessory 12 disc changer that is/was mounted onto the top of the battery cover in the trunk. Whether you have the changer mounted in your car or not the DIN cable is still in the car so you can easily mount a Fujistu Ten or Eclipse 12 disc cd changer of the same vintage (or any year as long as it uses the same DIN cable).

I usually open the lisp directory in dired, mark all *.el files (with % m .el$)

********* Patch
********* Method 1
Most patches can be installed by downloading the patch, changing into
the directory that you want to change, and typing

$ cat /location/of/the.patch | patch -p1

This will modify the files in the current directory.
********* 2
You can save the entire message and pass it to the patch command
while in the directory of the appropriate file. For example, grab a
planner patch and

cd planner
patch -p0 < somefile.patch
********* 3
You have already got two good answers, so I just want to point out
that this can be done in Emacs:  read the header of the patch to see
what file it modifies, and then type M-x ediff-patch-file.  Tell Ediff
that the patch is already in a buffer, namely the article buffer, and
then enter the file within your planner source directory to patch.
Afterwards, reload the patched file with M-x eval-buffer.
