Windoze Issues

* Configuration
** Wallpaper set
*** find  snake
*** temp files
*** fish is jpg
*** granite to USB key
** Activation

If you are install Windows XP back on the same machine and don't want to
bother with re-activation, save the wpa.dbi and wpa.bak files from the
c:\windows\system32 folder on the hard drive. Then skip activation during
installation, reboot into Minimal Safe Mode (F8 at boot), save copies of
the existing wpa.dbi and wpa.bak files, then replace them with the ones
from the original install.

Microsoft explains activation here:
