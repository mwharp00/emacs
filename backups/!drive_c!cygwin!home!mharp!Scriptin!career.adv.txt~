What are some of the best examples of general career advice?
Edit
By general, I mean not specific to your field (finance, tech, HR, media, etc.) but to anyone. It could be advice for someone looking for a job, trying to get a promotion, changing careers or for someone who has the job they want but who wants to excel at it.

Just looking for some golden nuggets of wisdom that have proven useful to you.

During two years of business school at Stanford, I wrote down the best advice from our professors and lecturers. This advice is from my favorite teachers and lecturers, including Andy Rachleff, Mark Leslie, Irv Grousbeck, Joel Peterson, Eric Schmidt, and many others.

Admittedly, a lot of this is focused on technology industry, but much is generally applicable. Thought it might be interesting to others.

    Successful people listen. You have two ears and one mouth. Use them in that ratio. You learn more when you listen than when you talk.
    Pareto principle: Always look for the 80/20. 80 percent of the value is delivered by 20 percent of the product/service. Focus on that 20 percent.
    The importance of passion. When Warren Buffet finds people to run his business, his key criteria is to find somebody who would do the job whether they would get paid or not.
    Be likable. People who are liked have the wind at their backs. So be liked.
    Just when you think you've got it 100% right, you can be taken down.
    People who are lucky make their own luck. And you only make your own luck by staying in the game.
    Put on "the cloak" of leadership. A large part of your role is to inspire and motivate your employees, and people will look to you for confidence. If you were on a plane with engine problems, you don't want the pilot to say "I am exploring a number of options and hope that...", you want him to say, "I will do whatever it takes to land this plane."
    The outcome of a negotiation is largely a function of your alternatives. Know your next best option.
    You will only be as good as the people you will recruit. Media & culture celebrate individuals, but teams succeed.
    The best scientists can explain complex issues in simple terms. Pretty good scientists can explain complex issues in complex terms.
    A's hire A's. B's hire C's. Always strive to hire people better than you are.
    Be a clear, fair manager. For example, when speaking to a business unit leader that isn't succeeding, say: "I want a strategy to win in 1-page and the objectives we need to hit each quarter to reach them."
    When considering a business opportunity, look for change. What inflection point are you taking advantage of? Without change, there is rarely opportunity.
    When in doubt, just keep selling. Not a bad default strategy to communicate to your team.
    Be humble. The markets are brutal to those who are arrogant.
    Understand what you don't do well. Surround yourself with people and resources that can do these things well.
    Practice self-discipline. Set targets, have timetables, have clear unambiguous goals. Life passes quickly - days, weeks, months, years, a lifetime. "Regret for the things we did, can be tempered by time. It is regret for the things that we did not do that is inconsolable."
    Be yourself. In group settings, you usually serve the group best by thoughtfully expressing exactly what you are thinking. Not necessarily what the group wants to hear.
    Learn to relax. Often overachievers are passionate about many things. Yet  it's important to learn not to always care so much. Try being indifferent to things that aren't that important.
    You've got to give trust to get trust. Treat people as you would want to be treated. Sometimes people take advantage of you. That's fine, don't do business with them again.
    Shoot for the moon.To be successful, don't follow the pack. If you want to win, don't hedge.


And, here is some good final advice (from Joel Peterson):

"Appreciate the people you work with, take care of your investors, celebrate successes along the way, communicate lavishly - good news and bad news, tell the truth, don’t try to maximize everything, and stop to smell the roses. Life is pretty short and most of what really matters doesn’t happen at the office."

Kartik Ayyar, here to learn.
Votes by Thomas Børstad, Anthony Frenet, Marc Bodnick, and 169 more.
I learnt a lot from my first boss and mentor, who till this day I sort of regard as my "professional parent" if you will.

Even though he was an engineer at heart, I'm quite grateful to him for instilling attitudes in me that one could never learn from a CS textbook or reading code.

    Even when you are right, don't be "dead right"
    The example he cited was that of driving in the right lane with a huge truck coming towards you in the wrong lane. You could be right, if you stuck to your lane, but you'd also be dead.

    This was when I was negotiating to get permission to get a bit in an inode for a project I was working on, one of the holy grails of precious resources for the product I worked on. While it was technically the right solution for the problem at hand, he correctly pointed out to me I was being overly blunt in pointing out to the people who could give me the appropriate blessing to get that bit I wanted why their solutions were flawed. ( In all fairness, I'm still not perfect at this, though I have gotten much better ).
    When in doubt, keep your mouth shut.
    Keeping your mouth shut has tremendous value a lot of the time. Filter your communication so that random thoughts stay in your head, and only the good ones make them out.
    After writing up an email, think many times before sending it.
    If in doubt, save it as a draft and sleep on it. You'll be surprised at how many drafts of "brilliant" ideas you will accumulate ( I'm well into the hundreds with respect to my work email, and almost in triple digits for Quora drafts ).
    If you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
    Spend time that you would have spent whining about something fixing it.
    Take ownership about everything that you do.
    Never do your job from the perspective of waiting for someone to assign some bug to you. Own what you are doing and ensure you have the appropriate follow through to get everything needed to get the job done.

    Last but not the least my two favorites:
    Try to learn exponentially.
    My boss mentioned this to me the first day I started my first real job, and I thought he was exaggerating and wrote it off as a joke, but it made a lot of sense in retrospect - one should leverage what you learn to accelerate your pace of learning.

    Always strive to work with surgical precision.
    If you ever find your self running around with a shotgun, that is a clear cut red flag that you should take a step back and rethink.

15 General Career Tips. These tips will also help you if you are looking for a perfect relationship.

1. Play the field - Don't be in a rush to find your passion. If you're unhappy at your company, or with your career, that's a good thing. It's a signal to yourself that you need to find something that suits you better. You have to experience the wrong relationship to know what you're looking for in the right one.

2. Your friends can help - Ask your most trusted friends their opinions about what you should do  with your career. Listen with an open mind. This isn't about doing what  other people tell you to do, but about trying to get some outside  perspective

3. Desperation is a major turn off - Relax and be confident in your ability to find the right job. If you don't really feel this way, start by pretending that you do. You'll be surprised how that leads to actual confidence.
"The more desperate you are to find 'the one' more likely you are to repel it,"

4. Be prepared to walk away even if it means you'll be on your own - You will never be desperate if you know you can make it on your own.  If you can't find the perfect opportunity, you may just need to go out  and create it—starting your own business, freelancing, or getting  creative in other ways.
If other people can do that, so can you.

5. Clearly ask for you what you want - The number one reason we don't get what we want in our careers is we don't ask for it. Why? It's because we're afraid of rejection. Get over it. And then devote your energy to what they will say yes to.

6. Put your best foot forward - Be yourself: Are you kidding?! Do you really want  everyone at the office to know your deepest personal issues? No, you  don't. "Instead act like a hard worker." Find the person in the office everyone looks up to (one level above you) and emulate her or him

7. Learn to read body language - No matter what the reason for the meeting, the body never lies. If  you can learn to read the signals, you can figure out how much he or she  is into you (or isn't). That's as true about a meeting with your boss  to discuss your latest idea as it is with a client or a date.
Dilated pupils, torso and feet facing you, tilting a head toward you:  All good signs. Fidgeting, no eye contact, fast nodding indicates  impatience and means that you should gracefully end the meeting as  quickly as possible and try again another way.

8. Don't talk too much - Most people spend more time with their co-workers than with their friends. Don't confuse the two. Just like a love relationship can be killed with TMI, so can your reputation at your job. For instance, never bad mouth your previous boss or company.

9. Never bash the competition, or yourself - You can't win the heart of a lover by insulting the competition. You  can't win the big promotion by bashing your in-house competitor, either.
Nine out of ten times you'll achieve the exact opposite of what you  intended. Instead step up your own game and be grateful  for the motivation.
And whatever you do, don't downplay yourself. It doesn't make you  look humble. It makes you look insecure. You can't expect someone to  love you if you don't love yourself.

10. Don't expect your company/boss/lover to change - If you've taken a job and then you discover that the company is too  uptight (or too relaxed), or your boss is a jerk, not much is going to  change that. Find a way to prosper despite it. Or get over it and move on.

11. Dress to win - Looks matter. The one who wins isn't necessarily the most gorgeous  guy or gal in the room. But a person who makes an effort to dress  appropriately attractive gets noticed. So does the one who dresses inappropriately. Most of us know enough to dress well for the big meetings, but the day-to-day interactions with your co-workers also matters

12. Too much self sacrifice leads to trouble - No one likes a martyr — not even the boss who expects you to do whatever it takes to get the job done.
So if you've put your life on hold for your job, you are only hurting  yourself. A healthy life outside of work refreshes you, expands your  network, sparks your creativity. Just like it's a bad idea to give up your friends or hobbies for your  love interest, it's a bad idea to give up the rest of your life for  your career.

13. Know when to let go - Just because your career — or relationship — has gotten stale,  doesn't mean it's time to quit yet. First, try adding some spice to it.
Take time to enjoy a feeling of accomplishment at the tasks that you  do well. See if you can power up that feeling of loving your work again.
Add some variety to your work — take on a new project, learn a new skills and try delegating the ones that most drain you.

14. Don't spend years in a mediocre situation - If your relationship with your company, or your career has stalled out, its easy to be lulled into complacency.
Don't waste your life on something mediocre. Change something at your  job to make it better for you and if you can't do that, don't lie to  yourself: It's time to move on.

15. Have others sing your praises - Before you put the word out that you are looking for new  opportunities within your network, "control your message".  "People not only believe but will repeat what you tell them." You want to be seen as someone "up and coming." If your network can't  do this for you, consider hiring a publicist or headhunter to help you  spread the good word.

Votes by Fabio Carriero, Marc Bodnick, Zachary Hamed, and 28 more.
While going through a few lectures and reading a few books about how one should build a successful career, I had made myself a list of things that I try to follow. I would share the same here.

    Mistakes - the best friend: Nothing in this world will teach you better about yourself than the mistakes you make, given you are willing to learn.
    Care for the path; end will be where it deserves to be: Most of our energy is spent pondering about the results of our actions, about whether we will get what we want and the like. The next time, do this instead - focus on what has to be done to reach where you want to. Leave the rest to rest.
    100 percent, each time: For once, vow to give a hundred percent effort in whatever you do. No activity ever requires 200 percent or 400 percent effort. A hundred percent, that's all. Each time.
    Don't hate criticism: Whatever the people say about you, they are inevitably showing you the ways you can still improve. So why not?
    Passion & Attitude: Never lose on these two elements. They determine, to a large extent, where you stand in life and what you achieve.
    Work Ethic: What qualities do you want to exhibit to the world about yourself. Optimistic, reliable, responsible, hard working etc. etc.? Devise a work ethic accordingly.
    Subjugate the self: Never let your 'self' and your 'ego' make a difference to you. Very often you can make a greater contribution to your career by playing second fiddle. Play non-striker.
    The harder you work, the luckier you get: Someone said the other day, Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. He put it perfectly.
    Share Knowledge: Life is a give-and-take relationship. Share your knowledge with people around you, if ever want someone else to be generous enough to do that with you.
    Live in the present: Often we are either too anxious for the future or remain absorbed thinking about the moments of the past. The best thing to do, however is, well you read the bold heading this bullet point.
    Know everything about you profession: If you are passionate about what you are doing, go on to make an effort to master it. All it demands is time. Loads of it. But then, this is all you ever wanted. You have it now. Opportunities and glory will be on their way.
    Stretch a little bit: "Because you can never tell how close you are,
                                   It may be near when it seems so far."
    Be humble: A very important virtue to have when moving ahead in life. Sometimes, we are just not 'humble' enough to receive what we want from life. And the result? We never get it.
    Seek people better than you: Because by what they do, they will show you how to be one of them. Very often would you realize just by being among them 'This is what I was missing.'
    Khudi ko kar buland itna ki har taqdeer se pehle Khuda khud bande se puchhe, 'Bata teri raza kya hai?': Its an Urdu phrase. Says, raise yourself to such a level that before God scripts your fate, he asks you, 'What do you want, my Son?'

Every morning, look in the mirror and ask yourself, "Is what I'm going to do today going to make me happy?"

If the answer's "No" for more than a week, either change your attitude or change what you're doing, because one of those two is wrong.

Some Quick Sage Advice for Young Employees Early in Their Careers
from 2X Entrepreneur Turned Venture Capitalist | Both Sides of The Table by Mark Suster

My  wife & I have a close friend who recently entered the workforce for  his first-ever job. On his first day of work my wife was kind enough to  write down words of wisdom from her years on the job.

http://www.bothsidesofthetable.c...

I  don’t write about Tania very often – mostly at her request. Otherwise  I’d shout from the mountain tops how smart & capable she is. She’s a  Brown undergrad, Wharton MBA, ex strategy consultant and ex Googler.  She’s worked for L’Oreal, Accenture, Virgin Mobile & BSkyB (one of  the leading media companies in the UK).
She is the disciplined, organized and detail-oriented member of the  Suster household. And she’s one hell of mom, with her super-motivational  schoolwork & music completion charts with daily measurements and  appropriate rewards for hitting milestones.
You know now why I would take her advice for new employees. She’s “type A” and I’m “type ADD.”
She gave me a special one-time permission to write about her in a  blog post so I could publish the advice she gave our friend. So consider  this my first-ever guest blog post. With a tiny bit of ghost writing  from me
. Cheesy stock photo mine, not hers.
Hope you enjoy.
*****************
Secrets of the real world – stuff I learned the hard way
General Advice

    Don’t expect constructive feedback without asking directly for it. Most businesses have formal programs in place to give you feedback.  Most bosses are too busy to put in the real effort to help you. Many  just ask you to fill out the forms for them. It becomes more  administrative than constructive. If you ask for feedback in a pleasant,  non-defensive way you will likely get it.
    You won’t really have a mentor unless lightening strikes. But if you seek one out, most talented employees would gladly become  your informal mentor. This can be your most valuable career management  tool so use it. It can be a great way to build advocates that will move  mountains for you in the future.
    People won’t communicate expectations clearly (you must ask, clarify, ask again). Knowing the expectations of your senior employees (and peers) is  invaluable to your success and asking people’s expectations is the  clearest way to get them to think about it in the first place. The  easiest way to beat expectations is for you and your boss to agree them  two-ways and check on progress periodically.
    Constructive criticism stings, but we all need it.  So seek it out, push for real feedback and be open to hearing it whether  you agree or not. If you’re defensive you’ll never get real criticism.  It’s much easier for your boss to avoid the confrontation or putting the  time into thinking through what you could do better.
    Don’t overly rely on HR. Make your boss and her  boss your primary allies. Your career is best navigated though line  managers. HR should be able to manage the sensitive information you give  them separate from your line managers but in my experience they do not  so be careful. They are not your free psychoanalysts.
    Show up early. You may be a morning person – you  may not. But nothing gets noticed more than which employees constantly  turn up late. Even if bosses say they don’t care – they do. Nothing  tarnishes your reputation more quick than being THAT person. The one  always slipping in late.
    Be humble. Nobody cares where you went to school or  how great of a student you were. Get over yourself. Don’t be arrogant.  Don’t try to act like a managing partner from day 1. It’s OK to be  junior. Nobody expects you to be managing the whole division. In fact,  they’ll resent you if you try to act like you are.

Working with Your Boss
Sit down with your boss asap and tell her you want to do an amazing job. Ask her:

    What could I do to exceed your expectations? What have past  employees done that made your life much easier? What tips would you pass  along from the most successful employees who have had this job?
    What is the worst thing I could do in this job that you want me to avoid?
    Whom should I emulate? Who is great in this role that I should learn from?
    How can I best help you?
    Where is the best bar around here? [Kidding, that's Mark ad-libbing. don't ask that!]

What to do in Your First Weeks

    Interview your peers, people in your role/team: set up a meeting and ask them same questions as above, plus:
    How can I best work with my boss, what does she love/hate?
    What mistakes did you make that I can avoid?

What is Your Job, Really?

    Your job is to make your boss’s job easier – to help your boss  succeed.  Always have that in mind even if it’s not in your immediate  job description
    NEVER bring your boss a problem without bringing him a few potential solutions (I wrote about this here “Bring Me Solutions, Not Problems”). Be associated with problem solving, not problems, it creates a positive halo around you
    Say “yes” to work even when don’t want to. Everybody loves employees  who take on projects with enthusiasm. The world is filled with people  who sigh when assigned work.
    BUT if you do become overwhelmed with work it’s ok to say “I need  your help prioritizing my tasks because I have too much on my plate.”   Make it a positive thing. The worst thing is to take on too much work  and under-deliver.

Other Notes

    Schedule in your calendar and in your bosses calendar a few check in  meetings and ask for feedback and make it a formal conversation.  Prepare them in advance by providing a list of the things you’re working  on developing and tell them you’d love feedback on how to improve at  those things.  You might want to preface with ”I want to learn how I’m  doing so I can improve, please give me constructive criticism!” Mostly  you don’t want them to feel like these meetings are obligations, reasons  for hours of preparations or ways for you to be defensive about your  job.
    So take the feedback on and don’t get defensive. The more you get  positive measurement on your work the more likely your boss will be  aware of it at the annual review time. Make sure to thank you for his  time (he is likely busier than you are, after all!)
    After you feel stable in your role and with your relationship with  your boss – make sure to get to know your boss’s boss. Don’t let your  boss love you but his boss not know who you are! This WILL come in handy  in your career but you have to manage this cautiously.

Welcome to the rest of your life, I know you will do great!

I recently came across this list and it looks to be very popular.  It is called 21 Suggestions For Success by H. Jackson Brown Jr.  No copyright infringement intended.  This is more about success in one's own personal life but I believe success in your life will transfer well into your career.
http://www.21suggestions.com/

    Marry the right person. This one decision will determine 90% of your happiness or misery.
    Work at something you enjoy and that's worthy of your time and talent.
    Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
    Become the most positive and enthusiastic person you know.
    Be forgiving of yourself and others.
    Be generous.
    Have a grateful heart.
    Persistence, persistence, persistence.
    Discipline yourself to save money on even the most modest salary.
    Treat everyone you meet like you want to be treated.
    Commit yourself to constant improvement.
    Commit yourself to quality.
    Understand that happiness is not based on possessions, power or prestige, but on relationships with people you love and respect.
    Be loyal.
    Be honest.
    Be a self-starter.
    Be decisive even if it means you'll sometimes be wrong.
    Stop blaming others. Take responsibility for every area of your life.
    Be bold and courageous. When you look back on your life, you'll regret the things you didn't do more than the ones you did.
    Take good care of those you love.
    Don't do anything that wouldn't make your Mom proud.

Think long-term...

Often when I have discussions with people around career management, the person seeking advice is seeking input on one of two issues.  Either they want advice on how to climb the ladder and get a more senior sounding title.  Or they don't like the person that they're working for, and they want advice on how or where to move. While both are certainly issues to think through, they are both very tactical.

My advice is take a step back and think more deeply about what you're trying to achieve and accomplish over a longer time horizon-- 5 years minimum, more likely 10 years.  Then think about, seek advice on, and understand what skills you need to gain in your toolkit in order to achieve those 10 year milestones. 

Once you have some inkling of what those longer term milestones and skill sets you need to build out, then its a relatively straightforward process to work backwards to the present day and set more short-term and intermediate goals and milestones.  You then have a rough path to navigate and you can be much more informed and directed as you pursue those goals.

The following idea dramatically changed my career:

Decide what you are worth, then demand it.

Let me be clear.  I am not saying, charge in your boss's office tomorrow, slam your fist down on the desk, and demand some princely sum. You are, in fact, not entitled to a high compensation just for being that special snowflake that is you.

Let me elaborate.  First, a few basic insights led me to this idea:

    Most bosses are very happy to pay you less than you're worth and ask less of you than you're capable. Most bosses fill positions to meet specific needs. If the need is being met under budget, all is well.
    We're lazy and risk averse. You're probably clinging to some comfort zone that gives off that warm feeling of mastery. It's hard to step out and demand more of yourself.
    Roles that offer higher rewards and greater challenges are not equitably handed out based on merit.  They go to those who demand them.
    We're deluded about negotiation. You probably think that compensation is dispensed equitably based on the rational system that your employer has constructed. It's a fraud designed to make you settle for less.


Don't misunderstand.  I'm not urging to become some money-chasing-super-climber. Follow your passions, make a difference, and always say "no" to golden handcuffs.

But don't get caught in the adequacy trap.  When I say, "demand it" I mean first demand it of yourself.  Someone once said, eagles don't chase mosquitos. Setting your price is one way to keep yourself honest and make sure you are challenging yourself to contribute at the level that you know you can.

Some thoughts on ladder climbing and corporate culture...

Understand that your manager:

    Doesn't think about your career and ascension nearly as often as you might think he/she does. So assume that you have to create your own strategy - it won't just be handed to you on a platter.
    Remembers but a few brief interactions to judge your worth/value. So be absolutely 100% intentional when you speak or act around your boss. In fact, plan out those interactions in advance by asking yourself what you want to accomplish.
    Does not consider themselves an enabler of your success.. if fact, they think that relationship is flipped. Remember that it is YOUR job to make your his or her life easier - and your job description is to do whatever they need done.
    Likes people who do a great job without adding excess drama. Managers love it when subordinates only come by to say that something is complete. Employees who complicate their manager's lives with requests and issues are foolish. Don't put trash in their bag.
    Is above you on the food chain, and likely more experienced and knowledgeable than you. You may think you can do a better job than they can, but disrespecting or taking a boss for granted is a very dangerous game...

    And I echo the earlier comment: Be liked. Only a select few can pull of the hard-nosed, results-driven, prick persona. That's a career strategy that can work well - but can also backfire badly. Having relationships based on trust and admiration is always a good career strategy.

Run to a job, not away from one.

This one particularly resonated for me. I think it's worth reading the rest of what he said on this topic - it's under section 4 after you get to the page.
