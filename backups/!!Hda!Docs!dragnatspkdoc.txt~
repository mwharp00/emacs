So let me see if I can understand the connections flying around here. Grace in attempting to make small talk with the UC art history department office manager chooses Emacs as something geeky. He comes up with a link to M-x calc. That was the entrance for Lenny into Emacs. I had recently watched a chat between Sasha Chua and Carsten Dominik. She was the maintainer of a package called planner that was my entrance into Emacs. Carsten Dominik is the author of org-mode, the current brightest star in the Emacs firmament. So what is he talking about? How cool Calc is. How the author of Calc assumed that he would hit a wall with the limitations of Emacs Lisp. Here is the link for the conversation between Sasha Chua and Carsten Dominik. Another conversation you should look at is John Weigley. He is the guy who actually wrote planner, remember, ledger, eshell and more. He has a MBP that he has extended rather amazingly. A search through his configuration would probably yield a lot.

Rude boy
amazing story you being in the belly of the beast there in Texas. I hope things are going well for you. We should probably take this off of the AA servers just in case I make a mistake. Sometimes I substitute Rectumplex for Metroplex, and you know the honor culture..." You think that's funny?"

When you are looking at uncertain things in the future, you still must quantify. That means take your best guess and then revisit it and continue to refine it. Is that a Bayesian process?
So what we are talking about here is a budget. We are at another money concept here. I read one financial planner that puts every client through a budget exercise. Now if you are making 20,000 a month; why go through an exercise of estimating what you spend on food? The reason is that it is still useful to identify overspending. Spending that does not reflect your own priorities. Also, she notes that most can cut one third of their spending with out significant pain. The goal is not to necessarily cut, but to know that you can. A budget should be a no fear thing. These are my priorities. They are reflected in how much I spend and what I spend it on. There is another level of complexity in a marriage. Two people and one budget that each has to buy into. I have no formula for you here other than to be explicit and to use tit-for-tat principles. You knew I would work that in somewhere, didn't you. Going back to the previous planner, we went from quantification to a budget, but she goes further. You need quantification in assets, liabilities, and future needs to obtain goals. Because this goes so deep into so many aspects of life, she recommends a bite-size approach. Get a steno notebook and spend 20 min. every other day putting together your plan. You are lucky. Where you are now is a pretty simple state. Also, you are starting young and by saving 10% of every gross dollar the two of you earn; I'm sure you will have 1 million bucks for your old age.
Now let's turn to the real estate question. To my mind, there is one clear benefit to buying a home and that is the mortgage interest deduction. This works out to a small subsidy for the amount of your mortgage payment that is interest. But remember that you are also assuming responsibility for a property that could create hugely expensive demands on you. You will think at some point, it sure would be cool to just call a landlord and be done. Many people talk about the "enforced saving" that buying a home ensures.maybe it is a bit bogus, in that it is a free country you can save what you want to save. But there is a truth buried here. That is that the virtuous cycle in real estate is a long term one. Houses over time appreciate maybe 3% to 5% a year. Maybe inflation is similar. So over 10 years the dollars that are paying your mortgage are cheaper and you have a bit of equity that receives the kicker of a higher value. But the transaction costs are brutal and the market can be fickle. I guess we can leave alone the 50% drop in home prices that wrecked so many in 2009. The point here is that you want every house that you will ever buy to be a house you would be happy to live in. It is clear that you value the Portland home more than the Vancouver home. You need to analyze the situation with all available numbers.
I was just thinking about the short conversation we had in front of the Atrium hotel. I think maybe I was a little self absorbed with my problems. I had no intentions of spreading fear, uncertainty, or doubt. Steve Sinclair a couple days in front of me sailed right through. Felix Hernandez a couple days behind me; no trouble. So in the scheme of things, the fact that I did some remedial sims is neither here nor there. Sorry for the noise. Have fun in the rectumplex. Could not resist.
I think the point to take away is that this is a spectrum. For instance, even when I was very house poor I never took out a loan for any other purchase. So I was simultaneously in the most conservative camp and the most go for it aggressive group. That is how you two should be. Look at what your personal minimum house would be on both sides of the Columbia. It is just running more numbers.

Both of these ideas look entirely valid to me.
