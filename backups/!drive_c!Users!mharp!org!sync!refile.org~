**** So let me see if I can understand the connections flying around here. Grace in attempting to make small talk with the UC art history department office manager chooses Emacs as something geeky. He comes up with a link to M-x calc. That was the entrance for Lenny into Emacs. I had recently watched a chat between Sasha Chua and Carsten Dominik. She was the maintainer of a package called planner that was my entrance into Emacs. Carsten Dominik is the author of org-mode, the current brightest star in the Emacs firmament. So what is he talking about? How cool Calc is. How the author of Calc assumed that he would hit a wall with the limitations of Emacs Lisp. Here is the link for the conversation between Sasha Chua and Carsten Dominik. Another conversation you should look at is John Weigley. He is the guy who actually wrote planner, remember, ledger, eshell and more. He has a MBP that he has extended rather amazingly. A search through his configuration would probably yield a lot.

So I was thinking that I had it really easy. Instead of LaGuardia to St. Louis I would go to Detroit, rent a car, and attend Uncle Bill's Memorial. Continuing on to St. Louis, I would be in position for work the next day. And for this, I was earning accolades from my family members? I learned once again that travel is not easy. The Eagle flight with plenty of open seats had none, then I was on, and then I was off. And then the woman ahead of me who got on because I was off, was off with the late arriving passenger. I'm not saying that I hate the TSA with the same vitriol as Kathleen, but as I changed back into my pilot uniform for a second security at the Delta terminal... So I got on, stuck in the cockpit jump seat, but on my way to the ancestral Michigan. Huge line at Hertz, and my fourth change of clothes but I made it to the church with a mere fifteen minutes to spare. It was a pretty large church complex and since the church was locked, I deduced that I should head to the chapel. There was a reception area and it was pretty well attended.
