** TODO edit area in FF and Tbird
 - I just came across
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125 which is a firefox
plugin that provides an 'edit' button for any text area in a form.
clicking on this button prompts the user for the editor they want to
use and you can configure things using emacsclient etc to use
emacs. so, with this add-on, you can possibly get the best of both
worlds. browse with firefox and then when you need to enter text in a
text area, get the power of using the real thing, emacs.
