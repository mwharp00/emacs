Other systems tend to store data as changes to a base version of each file.
Git doesn't think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more
like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of
your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at
that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not
changed, Git doesn't store the file again-just a link to the previous identical file it
has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like Figure 1-5.
