So I go to the airport for the last flight Monday night, that's
Memorial Day.  There are maybe eight seats and one other St. Louis
pilot listed.  When I arrive at the gate Bob Stack, the other
St. Louis pilot who by the way spent twentysomething years in the
rescue squadron on Long Island, the 129th sister squadron and of
"Perfect Storm" fame; says, "You heard what happened didn't you?"  The
previous flight taxied for two hours then came back to the gate as per
the new law at which point the flight was canceled.  How can everybody
be worse off after passing a bill called the passenger bill of rights?
I had six days of work scheduled but I had not used much sick leave
lately and I thought with this many days off I'll be able to complete
an e-mail to my siblings.  It is now Saturday afternoon and I have
begun.  ed. Monday afternoon argghh.

Here is the information.  The place is called the Gulf Coast Grill.
They have a website gulfcoastgrill.com.  The reservation is for 12
at 6:30 PM.

Jay and Janet Silverberg are located at 109 Round Court, Petaluma,
California, 94952.  Their phone number is 707-765-4585.  Their e-mail
address is  silver@sonic.net.

After talking to Kathleen, I feel it is best to address this to Janet.
So, Dear Mrs. Silverberg Thank you so much for offering to show my
resume to you brother.  Please let me know what is the easiest way to
make myself available to you.  My phone is..., my e-mail is..., my
address is..., until July 15 and then....  I am interested in the
whole range of issues involved in my transition from the university to
the workplace.  So please don't hestitate to give criticisms,
suggestations to research, additional education, and blah, blah,
blah...

Dona-

So here is the deal.  The statements 8 Oct 09 to 9 Sep 10 are
attached.  She paid by check until the 03/30/2010 electronic payment.
The November rework is indicated by the by the payment changing from
$2389.82 to $2300.00.  I ordered copies of the 5 checks and they are
arriving by US Mail in 7-10 business days!

I talked to Joan (my sister, Joan Kelly, executor of my deceased
parents' A/B trust and the source of the $200K) and she will call you
tomorrow.  Then I gave her the incorrect phone number.  I emailed a
correction but if it doesn't work out, she should be at home
530-993-4675 or cell 530-249-1819.

Dearest sibs-

Thanks for the additional send. I do have regrets in that I was
perhaps overly emotional yesterday. But then, I knew my siblings would
show me the necessary slack. I agree the emphasis is and must be on
the boys. They have us and we can assure John that that will be
enough. As far as knowing where they stand on all this, that will
become clear as we approach end game. Your stay in Belmont will add an
incredible amount of good information. Hope it happens.


Once again, I feel both of you have a very complete strategy going
forward. If I can restate, a steady emphasis to Barbara on the need
for a change, that the current situation is untenable for the welfare
of her sons. After that, everything Matt posted flows perfectly. I
like the way that a trip to San Diego is open-ended and simply a way
to create some room for some problems to be worked out. Justin and
Nicolas would be in a great environment so isn't that a great thing?
And here are some Southwest tickets, visit anytime.

Both of you are doing brilliant writing and being very observant with
all these many moving (and frequently moving erratically) pieces. I'm
sure it will take time and that there will be ups and downs: good luck
to us.

Joan, just got your latest (comment on Claudia's take) and I concur.
Get her to a brain mechanic and get her fixed up. I think a timeline
going back a few years would be effective in showing that a fix is not
easy to come by. Besides, we want only the best for her. Got a
treatment idea? Great!

Gary-

Sure intended to stop by after my R9.  I even found my original sheet
from the C&R.  Alas, sidetracked by NBC (not working for the 49er
game) and then alcohol.  Had the easiest one -- cargo fire.

See you around,

Kim-

I got a discounted 2009 KHS Alite 1000.  Reviews are all over the map.
Suprised how much technical knowledge is required. You ride around all
these rocks, with gears that a.  Also, managed to slam the pedal into my shin on day
one.  So I already have my novice badge.

Thanks for your write-up of R9,

===========

So back when this was a boring old thread about legal papers -- I had "Thanks, Joan. I received the papers in good order. I expected a little more of a yippee, I'm done type of thing. You are truly Dad's daughter with your matter of fact tone." Our intention with Sweden plans was to put out an email with you, Jenna, and Grace included. We will get this done. The more I think about it, we have to do a house, apartment, or flat. Maybe Matt can help with weekly rental all over the world piece. Hmm, how many bathrooms for 5 women?

Then on to Matt. Good luck on your business trip, those constraints sharpen your mind, steering between scylla and charybdis

This is a test for the new Dragon installation.
My name is Mark Harpster. I apologize in advance for any repetition; I hope it is not excessive. Also I wish to thank this board for allowing line pilots to speak. I'm a May 88 TWA hire. My background is light civil, 20+ years as a 130 pilot in a California Air Guard rescue squadron, and stints at two airlines; Transamerica which was an ALPA carrier and Southern Air Transport which was not. I bring up my experience as context for the fact that I chose TWA. My father flew at TWA from 1945 to 1980. However this was not a sentimental choice; it was an attempt to analyze the seniority structure of the major airlines. [Had I not messed up the interview at Flying Tigers, I would not be standing in front of you today.] So my story is one that has a relatively positive seniority basis. I upgraded to 727 First Officer while still on probation and upgraded to Captain in 1999. [As a San Francisco-based Captain living 18 min. from SFO and 50 min. from San Jose, I was happy.] I lived in San Francisco and the bulk of my career was San Francisco-based in both the right and left seats. Then a transaction occurred. My TWA number of approximately 450 became one in the 10,000 range. The seniority integration that was SuppCC was viewed by every TWA pilot I've spoken with as a defeat. But it was also a fact, the central fact for a TWA pilot. Starting in 2002, I knew and everybody knew that every FO I was flying with was going to be furloughed. Every FO on every flight. This was SuppCC in action. Some very elementary arithmetic made me realize that I would be in St. Louis for the duration of my career. This is because the assigned seniority was so low. Stated another way, only a very young person has enough time to wait for the 1000's of retirements (5,000? 6,000?) needed to make it to the midpoint of the list. So I bought a house near Forest Park that I set up as a crash pad for myself and other St. Louis commuters. And I reserved the LambertLeperColony email address. Many of the commuters into St. Louis were now native AA pilots displaced into St. Louis to replace the furloughed TWA pilots. This was SuppCC in action. In spring of 2005, I was displaced to 767 FO. At this low point, there were approximately 500 TWA captains on the street and far less than that still in the left seat at American Airlines. There were very few F0's not furloughed. SuppCC determined these numbers. My displacement was to 767 international, which at the time was essentially a DFW-Honolulu trip. Yes, it was SuppCC. You have seen the numbers. TWA pilots were furlough fodder. After three months, I was back commuting to reserve as a St. Louis MD-80 Captain. Fast forward eight years: I am 57 years old -- I am 220 on the TWA list. I am the bottom St. Louis 767 Captain withheld. This is not SuppCC in action. This is AMR executing something called a snapshot (from October) that is a placeholder until this interest arbitration is complete. My AA system seniority number is 6137. That holds Captain nowhere in this system. It is uncontroversial that SuppCC existed in the past. Everybody complied: the company, TWA pilots, and native AA pilots. Why did it exist? This is not a pedantic point; it was designed by AMR and APA. The TWA pilots just lived under it. Now, contract abrodgation sp? which means there is no SuppCC, which means there is no seniority integration?
